## Introduction to Machine Learning Pipelines: How to Prevent Data Leakage and Build Efficient Workflows

Repository for my talk on PyData Global 2023 on 8th Dec, 2023.

### Workshop goals

- Introduce data leakage and related issues
- Highlight the importance of machine learning pipelines to prevent data leakage
- Provide a strong familiarity with machine learning pipelines using open-source libraries (focus on scikit-learn)


### Walkthrough the notebooks:

1. Pre-processing (manual & column transformers)
2. Scikit-learn pipelines
3. Feature-engine and imbalanced-learn pipelines
4. PyCaret autoML pipelines
5. Spark ML pipelines
