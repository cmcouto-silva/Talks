## About Me

I am a dynamic and accomplished data scientist with over ten years of valuable experience in scientific research within academia, followed by three years of expertise in creating and deploying end-to-end machine learning applications in both startup and large global companies. Additionally, for nearly three years, I have embraced the freelance data science instructor role, sharing my knowledge and passion for the field.
